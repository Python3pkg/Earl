# Earl
Earl is the fanciest C++ extension for Python that allows External Term Format packing and unpacking.
This library can support packing and unpacking the External Term Format made popular by Erlang in Python. Written in C++ using the Python C API, it should be 
marginally usable across the various Python implementations, but for now I can guarantee CPython because that's what it was built against.

# Features
Currently Earl supports these features.

# Packing

* SMALL_INTEGER_EXT
* INTEGER_EXT
* FLOAT_EXT
* SMALL_TUPLE_EXT
* LARGE_TUPLE_EXT

# Unpacking

This feature is still being built.
